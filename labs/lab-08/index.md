# Lab 8

In this lab, we will implement online learning algorithm for wind distrubances and model inaccuracies using the MPC framework. Particularly, the goal is to implement a recent algorithm "Simulataneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control" (SSI-MPC) based on the paper Zhou et al., "Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret", TRO 2025.

# Lab 9
In this lab, you will implement the "Self-Adaptive Learning MPC for Tracking Unknown Dynamics" for the target tracking of Crazyflies in simulation. This is based on the paper presented in the lectures. We will build upon the MPC controller developed in Lab 4 (MPC for target tracking) and extend to learn the unknown dynamics of the target using the self-adaptive learning MPC framework.
